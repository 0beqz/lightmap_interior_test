# three.js lightmap interior test

A simple three.js demo scene where a lightmap that was generated in Blender using the addon The Lightmapper is tested. Ground reflections were made possible through box-projecting an env-map. The env-map was also generated in Blender. The scene and the textures were compressed using gltfpack and basisu. All textures are in KTX2 format.
